Practice and Analyze for productive data analytics 

Systems-Integrated Analytics (SIA)

Definition: Analytics built on a fully integrated* application/data environment so data, events, and business logic flow across systemsâ€”delivering consistent, real-time insights and closed-loop automation.

Why it matters: Streamlines operations, removes redundancy, speeds decisions, and improves agility with a single source of truth.

How it works:

 Integration fabric (APIs/iPaaS, CDC/ELT, event bus) connects apps and data.
 Semantic layer standardizes entities & metrics (e.g., CTR, CVR, CPA, CIP).
 Guardrails (e.g., CPA thresholds, data freshness/quality) protect outcomes.
 Insights trigger actions back into systems (e.g., MAB budget reallocation).

What success looks like:

Faster decision cycles, lower CPA at target volume, CIP-positive growth.
99%+ freshness SLA, consistent KPIs across tools, more decisions automated.
